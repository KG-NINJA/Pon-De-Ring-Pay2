# Pon-De-Ring-Pay2

This repository contains a simple top-down helicopter shooter. Fly across a large map, destroy warehouses, and survive waves of enemies. The game runs entirely in the browser using HTML5 canvas and vanilla JavaScript.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in a browser to play the game locally.

### Controls

- **Arrow keys/WASD**: Move and turn the helicopter
- **Space**: Fire the vulcan gun
- **Shift**: Launch a missile

Destroy all five warehouses to clear the stage. Survive long enough and a powerful battleship will appear. Taking it down yields a massive score bonus.

## Deploying with GitHub Pages
The included GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

To enable Pages:

2. Select **Pages** from the sidebar.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4. Save the settings.
